[I am currently working on the solution, I have not hit the second star yet]

I've decided to create a binary tree T for subsequences s of sequence M of
modifiable elements of our set A of adapters.
Each level L of the tree corresponds to subsequent element s_L of our
set A - height of the tree is hence equal to the number of elements of set A.


Alternatively we can create a ternary tree, where each child is a
following element of a sequence. Maximum height is the same as in T
but there is les
